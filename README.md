### Readme

Every project should have a Readme (usually a Markdown file). It should describe your specific project and have at least three sections:

1. **Project Name** and description.
1. **Installation** List any major dependencies, system requirements, and gotchas.
1. **Usage** How to run the project.

### Pull Request Template

This Markdown file prepopulates new Pull Requests. Using it as a prompt helps team members write infomative pull requests, makes code easier to test, and leaves a paper trail of code and decisions.

It can live in the `/.github` folder, the `/docs` folder, or the project root.

### Issue Template

Issue templates benefit developers and any other team members who may be performing QA or developing project requirements.

These markdown files prepopulate new Issues filed on github. When a team member files an issue, they are given different prompts based on what type of issue they are creating. For example, a Bug issue template may include steps to reproduce, and a CMS template may include optional vs. required fields.

You can create as many issue templates as you want. They live in the `/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory.

Each issue template needs to start with this markup:

```
---
name: Issue Type
about: Further description of this category.

---
```

This frontmatter will be used to populate the Issue Picker UI in Github.
